# Game over

## Assignment

Create a game using a 3rd party WebGL framework such as, PixiJS, Phaser, p5.js or three.js

## The game

We have created a game that is an easier and more simple version of the popular game germs.io. But instead of having a multiplayer version we wanted to create a relaxing game that you're able to play for just a few minutes or as long as you like.

[Play the game here!](https://germs-maybe.netlify.app)

## Code review

- [ ] `game.js:17-26` - You could do a function with only one for-loop for a more DRY code.
- [ ] `game.js:30-41` - This could also be made as a function.
- [x] `README.md` - Some kind of installation guide if you want to try the project locally.
- [ ] `Classes` -  We really like that you separated the classes, clean structure.
- [x] `Script.js:6` - 'e' is redundant in that function.
- [ ] Would be cool if you could loose the game when you're super tiny.

Cool game and nice work!!
